# Golang Practice

Just taking various algorithms and data structures and writing them in Go to get familiar with the language.  Some of the projects include:
- HTTP Packet Parser: written to solidify understanding of the structure of http packets.
- Subset function: algorithm to return all possible subsets of a given array of numbers
- Quicksort: self explanatory.  Also just a refresher on how it works.
- Binary Tree: when learning a language, I like to write a binary tree because it involves lots of varying techniques and programming constructs.
